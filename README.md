# DRL Based Wheeled Bipedal Robot in ROS 2 and Gazebo

This repository contains the URDF, meshes, and launch files for simulating a **Wheeled Bipedal Robot** in ROS 2 using Gazebo and RViz2. The final goal is to control and train the robot using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.

## üß† Project Goals

1. Visualize the robot model in RViz2.
2. Simulate the robot in Gazebo with realistic dynamics.
 3. Integrate sensors (IMU, encoders) and actuators (motors). -(on-progress)
4. Collect sensor data through ROS 2 topics.
5. Train the robot using Reinforcement Learning (future steps).
